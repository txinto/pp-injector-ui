Intended use:
- Consume these tools as a Git submodule (`poris/`) alongside your ESP-IDF project sources (sibling to `components/` and `esp_idf_project_configuration.json`).
- The tools are developer utilities; they need not be shipped with your firmware deliverables. If you redistribute them, retain copyright and license notices and acknowledge cosmoBots (https://github.com/cosmoBots/poris_idf_tools).
- Improvements are welcome; please contribute back so the community benefits.

Scope of the GPL:
- The tools themselves are GPLv3. Their use does not impose the GPL on the firmware/application you build with them, nor on configuration artifacts they generate (similar to how using GCC does not impose GPL on compiled outputs). You remain responsible for complying with licenses of any third-party code you include in your project.
